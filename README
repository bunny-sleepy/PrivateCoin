# Circom Playground

## Big Merkle R1CS and PLONK gate estimation

The big merkle circom implementation is in `test/circuits/testsha256.circom`. You can tweak the params (merkle tree size, number of iterations needed at each step) in that file.

To see the gate estimation, run:

```bash
> make 0_1_compile
> make plonk_info
```
